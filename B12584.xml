            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Efore I declare the iust time or manner of her Maiesties arriuall and entertainment at <hi>Eluetham,</hi> it is needful (for the Readers better vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of euerie part and processe in my discourse) that I set downe as well the conueniencie of the place, as also the suffising, by art and labour, of what the place in it selfe could not affoord on the sodaine, for receipt of so great a Maiestie, and so honorable a traine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eluetham</hi> house beeing scituate in a Parke but of two miles in compasse or thereabouts, and of no great receipt, as beeing none of the Earles chiefe mansion houses; yet for the desire he had to shew his vnfained loue, and loyall duetie to her most gratious highnesse, purposing to visite him in this her late progresse, whereof he had to vnderstand by the ordinarie Gesse, as also by his honorable good frendes in Court, neare to her Maiestie: his Honor with all expedition set Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificers a work, to the number of three hundred,
<pb facs="tcp:193721:3"/>many daies before her Maiesties arriuall, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large his house with newe roomes and offices. Whereof I omit to speake how manie were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stined to the offices of the Queenes houshold, and will onlie make mention of other such buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, as were raised on the sodaine, fourteene score off from the house on a hill side, within the said Parke, for entertainement of Nobles, Gentlemen, and others whatsoeuer.</p>
            <p>First there was made a roome of Estate for the Nobles, and at the end thereof a withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing place for her maiestie. The outsides of the walles were all couered with boughes, and clu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of ripe hasell nuttes, the insides with Arras, the roofe of the place with works of Iuy leaues, the floore with sweet herbes and greene rushes.</p>
            <p>Neare adioining vnto this, were many offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces new builded; as namely, Spicerie, Larderie, Chaundrie, Wine-seller, Ewery, and Panterie: all which were tyled.</p>
            <p>Not farre off, was erected a large Hall, for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment of Knights, Ladies, and Gentlemen of chiefe account.</p>
            <p>There was also a seuerall place for her maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties footemen, and their friends.</p>
            <p>Then was there a long Bowre for her maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties Guard.</p>
            <p>An other for other Officers of her Ma. house.</p>
            <p>An other to entertaine all commers, suiters, and such like.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:193721:3"/>
            <p>An other for my Lords Steward, to keepe his table in.</p>
            <p>An other for his Gentlemen that waited.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Most of these foresaid roomes were furnished with ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and the tables carried</hi> 23. <hi>yards in length.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreouer on the same hill, there was raised a great common buttrey.</p>
            <p>A pitcher house.</p>
            <p>A large pastery, with siue ouens new built, some of them foureteene foote deepe.</p>
            <p>A great kitchin with four ranges, and a boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling place for small boild meates.</p>
            <p>An other kitchin with a very long range, for the waste, to serue all commers.</p>
            <p>A boiling house for the great boiler.</p>
            <p>A roome for the scullery.</p>
            <p>An other roome for the Cookes lodgings.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Some of these were couered with canuas, and other some with bordes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Betweene my Lords house and the foresayd hill, where these roomes were raised, there had beene made in the bottom by handy labour, a goodly pond, cut to the perfect figure of a half moon. In this pond were three notable groÅ«ds, where hence to present her M. with sports, and pastimes. The first was a <hi>Ship Ile</hi> of 100. foot in length, and 40. foote broad: bearing three trees orderly set for 3. masts. The second was a <hi>Fort</hi> 20. foot square euery way, and ouergrown with willows. The 3. &amp; last was a <hi>Snayl mount,</hi> rising to
<pb facs="tcp:193721:4"/>foure circles of greene priuie hedges, the whole in height twentie foot, and fortie foote broad at the bottome. These three places were equally distant from the sides of the ponde, and euerie one by a iust measured proportion distant from other. In the said water were diuers boates pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for Musicke; but especially there was a Pinnace, ful furnisht with masts, yards, sailes, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chors, cables, and all other ordinarie tackling; &amp; with iron peeces; and lastly with flagges, strea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, and pendants, to the number of twelue, all painted with diuers colours, and sundry deuises. To what vse these particulars serued, it shall eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently appeare by that which followeth. And therefore I am to request the gentle Reader, that when any of these places are briefly specifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the sequele of this discourse, it will please him to haue reference to this fore-description; that in auoiding tantilogies, or reiterations, I may not seeme to them obscure, whom I studie to please with my plainnesse. For Proeme these may suffise: nowe to the matter it selfe: that it may be <hi>vltimÅ« inexecutione</hi> (to vse the old phrase) <hi>quod primum fuit in intentione,</hi> as is vsuall to good carpenters, who intending to build a house, yet first lay their foundation, &amp; square many a post, and fasten manie a rafter, before the house be set vp: what they first purposed is last done. And thus much for excuse of a long foundation to a short building.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>N the tvventith day of sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember being Munday, my Lord of Hertford ioyfully expecting her Maiesties comming to Eluetham to supper, as her Highnes had promised: after dinner, vvhen euery other needful place or point of seruice vvas esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished and set in order, for so great an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment, about three of the clocke his Honor seing all his Retinevv vvell moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and ready to attend his pleasure, hee drevv them secretly into a chief thicket of the Parke, vvhere in fevv vvords, but vvell couched to the purpose, hee put them in mind, vvhat quietnes, and vvhat diligence, or other duetie they vvere to vse at that present: that their seruice might first vvork her Maiesties content, &amp; thereby his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, and lastlie their ovvn credite, vvith in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crese of his loue &amp; fauour tovvards them.

This Poet vvas clad in greene, to signify the ioy of his thoughts, at her entrance a laurel garland on his head, to expresse that <hi>Apollo</hi> vvas patrone of his studies: an oliue branch in his hand, to declare vvhat continual peace and plentie he did both vvish and aboade her Maiestie: and lastly booted, to beto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken that hee vvas <hi>vates cothurnatus,</hi> and not a loose or lovve creeping Prophet, as Poets are interpreted by some idle or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uious ignorants.</p>

When the Poets speach was happily ended, and in a scroule deliuered to her maiestie (for such was her gratious acceptance, that she deined to receiue it with her owne hande) then these sixe Virgins, after performance of their humble re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence to her highnesse, walked on before her towards the house, strewing the way with flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and singing a sweete song of six parts to this dittie, which followeth.</p>

            <p>This song ended with her Maiesties entrance into the house: where shee had not rested her a quarter of an houre: but from the Snail-mount, and the Ship-Ile in the Pond (both being neare vnder the prospect of her Gallerie windowe) there was a long volley of Chambers dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. After this, supper was serued in, first to her Maiestie, and then to the Nobles and others. Were it not that I would not seem to flatter the honorable minded Earle: or, but that I feare to displease him, who rather desired to expresse his loyall dutie in his liberall bountie, then to heare of it againe, I could heere willingly particulate the store of his cheare and prouision, as likewise the carefull and kind diligence of his seruantes, expressed in their quiet seruice to her Maiestie, and the Nobility, and by their louing entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to all other, frends, or strangers.

Yet it helde vp a little before dinner time, and all the day after: where otherwise faire sports would haue beene buried in foule weather.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:193721:10"/>
            <p>This day her maiestie dined, with her No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles about her in the roome of estate, new buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on the hil side, aboue the Ponds head. Ther sate below her, many Lords, Ladies, &amp; Knights. The manner of seruice, and abundance of dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, I omit vpon iust consideration, as also the Ordinance discharged in the beginning of din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
            <p>Presently after dinner, my Lord of Hertford caused a large Canapie of estate to bee set at the ponds head, for her maiestie to sit vnder, and to view some sportes prepared in the water. The Canapie was of greene satten, lined with greene taffeta sarcenet; euerie seame couered with a broad siluer lace; valenced about, and fringed with greene silke and siluer, more then a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bredth in depth; supported with four siluer pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers moueable; and deckt aboue head with four white plumes, spangled with siluer. This Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie being vpheld by foure of my Lordes chiefe Gentlemen, and tapestry spread all about the pondes head, her maiestie about foure of the clocke came, and sate vnder it, to expect the issue of some deuise, being aduertised, that there was some such thing towards.</p>
            <p>At the further end of the ponde, there was a Bower, close built to the brinke thereof; out of which ther went a pompous aray of seapersons, which waded bresthigh, or swam til they appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched neare the seat of her maiestie. <hi>Nereus,</hi> the
<pb facs="tcp:193721:10"/>prophet of the sea, attired in redde silke, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing a cornerd-cappe on his curlde heade, did swimme before the rest, as their pastor &amp; guide. After him came fiue Tritons brest-high in the water, all with grislie heades, and beardes of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers colours and fashions, and all fiue cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully sounding their Trumpets. After them went two other Gods of the sea, <hi>Neptune</hi> and <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceanus,</hi> leading betweene them that Pinnace, whereof I spake in the beginning of this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise.</p>
            <p>In the pinnace were three Virgins, which with their Cornets played Scottish Gigs, made three parts in one. There was also in the saide pinnace an other Nymph of the sea, named <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aera,</hi> the old supposed loue of <hi>Syluanus,</hi> a God of the woodes. Neare to her were placed three ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent voices, to sing to one lute, and in two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther boats hard by, other lutes and voices to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer by manner of Eccho: after the pinnace, &amp; two other boats, which were drawne after it by other Sea-gods, the rest of the traine followed brest-high in the water, all attired in ouglie ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine suites, and euerie one armed with a huge woodden squirt in his hand: to what end it shal appear hereafter. In their marching towards the pond, all along the middle of the current, the Tritons sounded one halfe of the way, and then they ceasing, the Cornets plaid their Scottish gigs. The melody was sweet, &amp; the shew stately.</p>

            <p>The same day after dinne, about three of the clocke, ten of my L. of Hertfords seruants, al So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mersetshire men, in a square greene Court, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her maiesties windowe, did hang vp lines, squaring out the forme of a Tennis-court, and making a crosse line in the midle. In this square they (beeing stript out of their dublets) played fiue to fiue with the hand-ball, at bord and cord (as they tearme it) to so great liking of her high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, that she graciously deyned to beholde their pastime more then an houre and a halfe.</p>
            <p>After supper there were two delights presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto her maiestie: curious fire-workes, and a sumptuous banket: the first from the three I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands in the pond, the second in a lowe Gallerie in her maiesties priuie garden. But I will first briefly speake of the fire-works.</p>
            <p>First there was a peale of a hundred Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers discharged from the Snail-mount: in coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter wherof, a like peale was discharged from the Ship-Ile, &amp; some great ordinance withall. Then was ther a Castle of fire-works of al sorts, which played in the Fort. Answerable to that ther was in the Snail-mount, a Globe of all maner of fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works, as big as a barrel. When these were spent
<pb facs="tcp:193721:16"/>on either side, there were many running rockets vppon lines, which past betweene the Snayle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount, and the Castle in the Fort. On either side were many fire wheeles, pikes of pleasure, &amp; balles of wilde fire, which burned in the water.</p>
            <p>During the time of these fire-workes in the water, there was a banket serued all in glasse and siluer, into the low Gallerie in the Garden, from a hill side foureteene score off, by two hundred of my Lord of Hertfordes Gentlemen, euerie one carrying so many dishes, that the whole number amounted to a thousand: and there were to light them in their way, a hundred torch-bearers. To satissie the curious, I will here set downe some particulars in the banket.</p>
